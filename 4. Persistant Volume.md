## Kubernetes Pesistent Volume

A Persistent Volume (PV) is a piece of networked storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator. It is a resource in the cluster just like a node is a cluster resource. PVs are volume plugins like Volumes, but have a lifecycle independent of any individual pod that uses the PV
#### Creating a Volume

Create a yaml file for PersistentVolume creating,

```
vi Volume.yaml
```

Paste the below value:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: demo
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 5Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Recycle
  nfs:
    path: /srv/demo
    server: kubernetes-1
```

Now,

```
kubectl create -f volume.yaml
```

Sample Output:

```
kubectl create -f volume.yaml
PersistentVolume "demo" created
```

We can check that by

```
kubectl get pv
```

Sample Output:

```
kubectl get pv
NAME      CAPACITY   ACCESSMODES   RECLAIMPOLICY   STATUS      CLAIM           REASON    AGE
demo      5Gi        RWO           Recycle         Available                             11h
```

## Kubernetes Pesistent Volume Claim

A PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is a request for storage by a user. It is similar to a pod. Pods consume node resources and PVCs consume PV resources. Pods can request specific levels of resources (CPU and Memory). Claims can request specific size and access modes (e.g., can be mounted once read/write or many times read-only).

#### Creating a Claim

Create a yaml file for claim creating,

```
vi claim.yaml
```

Paste the below value:

```
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: demo
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 2Gi
```

Now,

```
kubectl create -f claim.yaml
```

Sample Output:

```
kubectl create -f claim.yaml
PersistentVolumeClaim "demo" created
```

We can check that by

```
kubectl get pvc
```

Sample Output:

```
kubectl get pvc
NAME        STATUS    VOLUME    CAPACITY   ACCESSMODES   AGE
demo        Bound     demo      5Gi        RWO           10s
```
