## Kubernetes Secrets

A DaemonSet ensures that all (or some) nodes run a copy of a pod. As nodes are added to the cluster, pods are added to them. As nodes are removed from the cluster, those pods are garbage collected. Deleting a DaemonSet will clean up the pods it created.

In a simple case, one DaemonSet, covering all nodes, would be used for each type of daemon. A more complex setup might use multiple DaemonSets would be used for a single type of daemon, but with different flags and/or different memory and cpu requests for different hardware types.

#### Creating a Secret

Create a yaml file for DaemonSet creating,

```
vi daemonset.yaml
```

Paste the below value:

```
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: hello-daemonset
spec:
  selector:
      matchLabels:
        name: hello-daemonset
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: hello-daemonset
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        name: registry
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          protocol: TCP
        resources: {}
        terminationMessagePath: /dev/termination-log
      serviceAccount: default
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 10
```

Now,

```
kubectl create -f daemonset.yaml
```

Sample Output:

```
kubectl create -f daemonset.yaml
daemonset "hello-daemonset" created
```

We can check that by

```
kubectl get daemonset
```

Sample Output:

```
kubectl get daemonset
NAME              DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     NODE-SELECTOR   AGE
hello-daemonset   2         2         2         <none>          10h
```

We can check in the pods, in which host they are running:

```
kubectl get pods
```

Sample Output:

```
kubectl get pods
NAME                              READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
hello-daemonset-d8jw2             1/1       Running   0          10h
hello-daemonset-mr1gh             1/1       Running   0          10h
```

Since we have 2 nodes, (master and minion) only 2 pods have been created
We can check it by the below commands,

```
kubectl describe pod/hello-daemonset-mr1gh | grep Node
Node:           kubernetes-2/192.168.0.54
```

```
kubectl describe pod/hello-daemonset-d8jw2 | grep Node
Node:           kubernetes-1/192.168.0.71
```
