## Kubernetes StatefulSets

A StatefulSet is a Controller that provides a unique identity to its Pods. It provides guarantees about the ordering of deployment and scaling.

#### Creating a StatefulSets

Create a yaml file for StatefulSets creating,

```
vi sets.yaml
```

Paste the below value:

```
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 80
    name: web
  clusterIP: None
  selector:
    app: nginx
---
apiVersion: apps/v1beta1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: web
spec:
  serviceName: "nginx"
  replicas: 3
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 10
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: gcr.io/google_containers/nginx-slim:0.8
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          name: web
        volumeMounts:
        - name: www
          mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
  volumeClaimTemplates:
  - metadata:
      name: www
    spec:
      accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 1Gi
```

Now,

```
kubectl create -f sets.yaml
```

Sample Output:

```
kubectl create -f sets.yaml
statefulset "web" created
```

We can check that by

```
kubectl get statefulset
```

Sample Output:

```
kubectl get statefulset
NAME      DESIRED   CURRENT   AGE
web       2         1         12h
```
